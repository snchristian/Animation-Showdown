# :game_die: Animation Showdown

This simple application allows users to pit their favorite animated characters against each other and see who would win. 

## :page_facing_up: Overview

In this project, using a Json server, I created a fighter mini-game. This app allows you to pick which animated characters would win. After five round, the winners you predicated would in each fight are shown against the winners that are randomly chosen from each round. 
## :sparkler: Features

 Display a unique Fighter Card with the name, image, and battlecry.
 Fighters can be added through a form.
 A total will be generated with how many winners you accurately pick.
